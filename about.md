I'm a recent PhD grad from Cornell in chemical and biomolecular engineering and a former modeling and simulation intern with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Novartis.
Although I have extensive modeling experience, I'm rather new to true "data science" and even newer to blogging.
I'm also passionate about health and fitness, which will undoubtedly influence some of the projects featured on this blog.
It should be an interesting journey!
